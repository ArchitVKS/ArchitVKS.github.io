## Projects

### Toe Rehabilitation Device (Patent Pending)
Turf Toe is an injury that affects the mobility of an individual's big toe, most commonly affecting the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ). A novel assistive rehabilitation device that caters to the several phases of treatment for the injury was developed. The device created would provide the assistive as well as resistive forces needed for rehabilitation in two phases.

<!-- - Phase One of the device provides gentle stretching exercises to help regain motion. As the initial pain subsides, regular controlled motion needs to be offered to the big toe providing pitch and yaw motion in the form of assistive motion with the help of motors.
- Phase Two of toe rehab involves stresses that are slowly applied to the tissues. In this phase, the device will enable the patient to apply pressure on the toe in the downward direction to build muscle strength and count the number of repetitions for the same to facilitate a routine for rehabilitation exercises. No active forces need to be added to the main toe. There is resistance provided to the user with the help of the servo motor, which they must overcome. -->


### SmartCage for human-drone interactions[Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369195638_A_Drone_Teacher_Designing_Physical_Human-Drone_Interactions_for_Movement_Instruction) 
Designed a novel SmartCage that is 63% lighter than any commercially available cage for DJI Tello EDU drone using Solidworks. The 3D printed cage prototype is the first drone cage that can house proximity and tactile sensors enabling the drone to localize itself around subjects in a human-drone collaborative dance performance. The shape, texture, form factor, color, and aerodynamics of the SmartCage was carefully considered to maximize utility while minimizing weight and enhancing a humanâ€™s ability/desire to engage with the drone physically.

### Police Work Traffic Light Controller
Designed and fabricated a wearable protoype device using Solidworks and 3D printing for traffic police officers. The device is embedded with MPU6050 IMU module and arduino nano to detect the orientation and direction of hand gestures of police officers to control traffice lights in real time. The light controller is a standalone device that is powered by a portable power bank and communicates with a retrofitted traffic light controller wirelessly, via a radio module within the device.


### Obstacle Avoidance, Target Recognition and Line Following Robot
Programmed and retrofitted a boe bot robot chassis with a Parallax Propeller microcontroller, infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and a raspberry pi camera. An algorithm was programmed to allow the robot to follow a line using infrared sensors and detect obstacle in a 180 degree field of view using ultrasonic sensors, and ArucoTag detection using OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi 4 was achieved. A firmware algorithm was programmed for the Parallax Propeller microcontroller, enabling it to efficiently execute line-following, object detection, and avoidance tasks simultaneously. In addition, a novel target elimination mechanism using launched projectiles was design and fabricated using Solidworks and 3D printing.
